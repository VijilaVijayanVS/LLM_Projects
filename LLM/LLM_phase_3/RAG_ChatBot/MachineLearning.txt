Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. It leverages algorithms to identify patterns, extract insights, and improve performance over time as more data becomes available. Machine learning techniques are widely applied across industries, from healthcare for disease prediction and personalized treatment, to finance for fraud detection and stock market forecasting, and even in everyday technology such as recommendation systems, speech recognition, and autonomous vehicles. By automating complex tasks and uncovering hidden patterns in data, machine learning is transforming the way organizations operate and make data-driven decisions.
