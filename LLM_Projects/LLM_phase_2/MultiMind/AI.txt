Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a transformative field of computer science that enables machines to mimic human intelligence, learn from data, and make decisions or predictions with minimal human intervention. It encompasses a wide range of technologies, including machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics, which allow systems to analyze complex datasets, recognize patterns, understand speech, and even generate human-like text or images. AI is increasingly integrated into everyday life, powering applications such as virtual assistants, autonomous vehicles, personalized recommendations, and predictive analytics. Its rapid evolution promises significant benefits across industries like healthcare, finance, education, and manufacturing, while also raising important ethical considerations around privacy, bias, and accountability.
